    <h1>- - ABOUT ME - - </h1>
    <img src="https://images49.fotki.com/v22/photos/6/1325826/10657042/BLACKCATSBLINKINGEYES-vi.gif"> Hi!! My name is <strong>Gia Rizvi</strong>. I am a 17 year old rising senior ('23) from Los Angeles, California. I have two sisters, a cockatiel named Toto, and a turtle named Keith. 

    <p>I decided to take this class because I'm very new to IT and it seemed like an exciting opportunity and introduction to the subject. I've never been so faraway from home while also away from my family either, so a summer college in New York where I live on campus is a completely new experience. It's a good opportunity got me to learn dorm life while also being introduced to a subject I'm not as familiar with! I'm specifically interested in learning programming :)</p>
    
    <h2>My interests</h2>

    <p>
    Outside of class, I love a lot of things. I enjoy games such as genshin and persona, but my favorites are rhythm games. They test my reaction time and quick thinking, and the music is always so good. I also like anime, marvel but really spiderman specifically, drawing, and music (especially vocaloid!) I am in band and can play clarinet, tenor sax, and violin. I also have a cockatiel named toto and a turtle named keith.

    I'm excited to get to know all of you and make new friends!!
