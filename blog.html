    <h1>Interview with Jeff Fouts in IT Girls Tech Scavenger Hunt!</h1>
    <p>Gia Rizvi / July 21st, 2022</p>

    <h2>Associate Director of Career Services and Data Analytics shares what his job entails</h2>

    <p>Today, the IT Girls participated in a tech scavenger hunt, making us go around campus in groups of 3 and interview a variety of staff. One specific person my group and I interviewed was Jeff Fouts. He manages career service and data analytics, which entails managing the jobs students go into and even helping them find said jobs, internships, etc. He also helps with resumes, cover letters, interviews, and more.</p>

    <p>One very interesting thing he found during his work was that there is actually a larger amount of women enrolled in the Syracuse University ischool at the moment compared to men. Not only that, but many of their starting salaries once they go into a career have shown to be higher as of now, by up to 7 thousand dollars. With an increase of women already in the ischool, he advises the IT Girls that IT and data related fields can be in just about anything, and itâ€™s a very important field to get into and recognize.</p>

    <p>Because his job requires managing data, he knows this information because his job even requires checking what career students go into after they graduate. This is how data is involved in his job. Not only can he use data to find where students are getting jobs, when, and how, but it can also be used to understand how well he and his faculty is doing in aiding these students. He also uses numerous technologies on a daily basis in his work. The most notable ones he uses are by the names of Handshake, LinkedIn, and Excel. Handshake is a program used by all of the university, and it allows him to easily manage data and put it into an Excel spreadsheet.</p>
