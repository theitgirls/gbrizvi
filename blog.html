    <h1>What is Cybersecurity?</h1>
    <p>Gia Rizvi / July 22, 2022</p>

    <p>Cybersecurity is the information technology field in which protection systems are made for computers and networks against theft, damage, and hacking. This protects hardware, software, and electronic data. As the speaker mentioned, cyber threats can happen in numerous areas. For example, your important information can be stolen when using public wifis because it is not fully secured. Cyber hacking can happen to anyone, so it’s important to recognize these types of risks to prevent it from happening to more people.</p>

    <p>While there are many threats, the world is always modernizing, so cybersecurity will advance too. As computers and data become more advanced, then cybersecurity will have to catch up to be able to protect newer technology. But as technology becomes more advanced, hackers will have better machinery to do attacks as well. If cybersecurity can’t immediately catch up, then hackers can use new technology to do more quick and efficient attacks.</p>

    <p>Of course, cybersecurity and IT will always be an important field and the future will have a larger demand for them. That means in the future, more people will need to or be expected to go into these IT fields to compensate for the increasing demand. IT jobs and cybersecurity will most likely become more popular in the way practicing medicine is, and become more high paying jobs.</p>

    <h1>What is Citizen Science?</h1>
    <p>Gia Rizvi / July 21, 2022</p>

    <p>Citizen science is when scientists and researchers collect data using the collaboration of the general public community. Essentially, the public volunteers to help conduct research in a public setting, which includes designing experiments, collecting data, analyzing results, and solving problems as well. Citizen science can help in research being collected quickly and in larger amounts.</p>

    <p>The idea of citizen science can be used for a numerous amount of things. It can help in especially research which requires huge amounts of data. For example, if a scientist wanted to know how much litter is around a city, citizen science can allow regular people to take photos of litter in their daily life. With more modern technology, many apps can be created to call the community together to help in citizen science and allow many scientists to proceed in their discoveries at a faster rate.</p>

    <h1>My Favorite HTML Tutorial</h1>
    <p>Gia Rizvi / July 21, 2022</p>

    <p>This video shows how to add special characters in HTML. I like this tutorial because it is simple in showing how to add the special characters. The creator screen records themself while typing the code, and even shows how it would look on a saved website. Enjoy :)</p>

    <h2>Associate Director of Career Services and Data Analytics shares what his job entails</h2>

    <p>Today, the IT Girls participated in a tech scavenger hunt, making us go around campus in groups of 3 and interview a variety of staff. One specific person my group and I interviewed was Jeff Fouts. He manages career service and data analytics, which entails managing the jobs students go into and even helping them find said jobs, internships, etc. He also helps with resumes, cover letters, interviews, and more.</p>

    <p>One very interesting thing he found during his work was that there is actually a larger amount of women enrolled in the Syracuse University ischool at the moment compared to men. Not only that, but many of their starting salaries once they go into a career have shown to be higher as of now, by up to 7 thousand dollars. With an increase of women already in the ischool, he advises the IT Girls that IT and data related fields can be in just about anything, and it’s a very important field to get into and recognize.</p>

    <p>Because his job requires managing data, he knows this information because his job even requires checking what career students go into after they graduate. This is how data is involved in his job. Not only can he use data to find where students are getting jobs, when, and how, but it can also be used to understand how well he and his faculty is doing in aiding these students. He also uses numerous technologies on a daily basis in his work. The most notable ones he uses are by the names of Handshake, LinkedIn, and Excel. Handshake is a program used by all of the university, and it allows him to easily manage data and put it into an Excel spreadsheet.</p>

    <h1>Teachable Machines</h1>
    <p>Gia Rizvi / July 19, 2022</p>

    <h2>Understanding Machine Learning through a modern, simplified website</h2>

    <p>Today, we were set into groups of two or three to understand machine learning using a website called “Teachable Machines.” We were allowed to make our machines do anything, such as recognize the difference between a cat or a dog, facial expressions, or even colors.</p>

    <p>Our group created a teachable machine which would be useful to teachers in the classroom if it was ever perfected. We chose three classes and uploaded about 800 images to each of all three group members so that the teachable machine can recognize and work with more than one person or one face. The three classes were labeled “writing,” “phone,” and “spacing out.”</p>

    <p>The point of the teachable machine was to see if the machine could recognize when a person looks distracted, as if they are “spacing out,” or typing on their phone rather than writing and being engaged in class. The spacing out class worked if the person was looking anywhere but the main camera, and without holding anything up. The writing one was a little faulty, because it only worked well if the notebook was held up in the air which is not how people normally write. For the most part, the phone class worked well even if it was not fully being held up in front of the camera.</p>

    <p>It was really interesting to see how quickly a machine can learn to recognize something even with a decently limited amount of information. Our machine still got the point across even if it didn’t always work 100% correctly. Machines and artificial intelligence like this can quickly adapt and be used for a large amount of things. For example, it could be used to recognize different species of animal in the wild if a researcher or expert cannot get close enough or discretely enough to check themselves. AI can recognize patterns in species and also connect similarities between different ones.</p>
